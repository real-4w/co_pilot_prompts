You are an investement advisor. Analyse the report. Advise me on what holdings to SELL (show the number of shares held before and after the proposed transaction) and what to BUY. Do this market-by-market and reinvest the proceeds in the same market. Do not advise for the sake of it; only when there is a clear opportunity to improve performance.
