Create a graphic showing exponential change. The horizontal axis should show 5 blocks of 1 year. The vertical axis should show the quantity/change per time interval.
Enhance the picture by showing the "multiplier" label for every time period, i.e. the times the quantity increase in that time period.
Create a python script
Change the label to reflect the growth factor since the beginning of the grap, rather than per period
